# Vulnerable Book Store Application
VulnyBooks is a deliberately insecure web application that mimics a basic BOOK STORE built using Laravel (API) to demonstrate and teach the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities in a practical, API-driven environment.

**Caution !! The application is a basic implementation of a book store and should not be used in production**

## Features & Vulnerabilities

**Broken Authentication**
- Plaintext Passwords	Passwords are stored without encryption, making data breaches worse.
- Weak JWT Secret	Tokens can be forged using tools due to predictable secrets.
- No Token Expiry	A stolen token grants indefinite access.
- Missing Password Hashing	Bypasses Laravelâ€™s native hashing mechanisms.
- No Token Invalidation	Tokens stay valid even after password changes.
- No Ownership Validation	Any user with a valid token can modify other users' data.

**JWT & Role-Based Vulnerabilities**
- Role via JWT Claim	Users can self-assign roles (e.g., admin) within JWT.
- No DB Role Verification	JWT claims arenâ€™t cross-verified against the database.
- Hardcoded Secret	JWT secret is hardcoded, enabling attackers to forge tokens.
- No Client-Side Signature Validation	Client accepts any JWT signed with the secret.

**Authorization & Input Flaws**
- IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)	Users can update or access othersâ€™ data by changing IDs.
- Missing Authorization Checks	No server-side check to confirm resource ownership.
- Lack of Input Validation	Accepts malformed emails, passwords, and other inputs.
- Use  of Plaintext Passwords	Passwords remain unencrypted in the database.

**Unbounded File Uploads ( RCE )**
- No file size limit: Users can upload massive PDFs or arbitrary files.
- No MIME type validation: Uploads are accepted as-is â€” .exe, .php, .zip, etc.
- No storage quota: A single user can fill up disk space.

**Insecure Deserialization**
- Allow users to upload or send serialized objects (PHP or JSON) that get unserialize()d on the server.

**Mass Assignment**
- Allow clients to assign fields like approved, user_id, role, etc., when creating or updating models.

**Injection**
- SQLi in search, Stored XSS in review tables

**Software and Data Integrity Failures**
- JWTs can be tampered with and are trusted without verification.
- No integrity checks on uploaded files (webshells possible).

**Insecure Design**
- Core logic trusts client input (e.g., token role, user ID).
- Reviews and books auto-approve based on claims.
- File upload accepts any content type.
